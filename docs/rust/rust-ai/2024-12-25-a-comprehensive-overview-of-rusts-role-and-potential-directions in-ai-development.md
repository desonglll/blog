# A Comprehensive Overview of Rust's Role and Potential Directions in AI Development

## Introduction

The introduction of [ChatGPT](@inproceedings{Radford2018ImprovingLU,  title={Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training},  author={Alec Radford and Karthik Narasimhan},  year={2018},  url={https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49313245} }) has ushered in a new golden era for artificial intelligence (AI), redefining the application landscape through large language models (LLMs). With their unprecedented capabilities, have significantly lowered barriers to application development, enabling the creation of innovative and diverse AI-driven products. This dynamic ecosystem of creativity exemplifies the transformative potential of modern AI.

The large language model (LLM), epitomized by ChatGPT, is at the heart of this revolution. [LLMs excel at generating text sequentially based on contextual input, showcasing exceptional comprehension and generative abilities that surpass those of earlier AI models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) Their remarkable performance is a direct result of their scale, characterized by an immense number of parameters. However, this scale comes at a cost: substantial computational resources are required to load and execute these models efficiently, making performance optimization a critical challenge.

LLM parameters comprise a vast array of numerical values, typically represented as FP32 floating-point numbers. Quantization techniques, such as converting parameters to FP16, BF16, or integer formats, offer a practical solution to mitigate memory demands and enhance execution speed. These methods reduce storage requirements while often improving computational efficiency.

Beyond quantization, the optimization of numerical computations often hinges on parallelization. Parallelism has become the cornerstone of performance enhancement in LLMs and deep learning. Specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, are designed to maximize parallel processing capabilities. Even in the absence of such devices, modern CPUs—including those in mobile platforms—can exploit data-level, instruction-level, and thread-level parallelism to achieve significant performance gains. Additional optimizations can be realized by refining storage hierarchies and optimizing data transfer mechanisms.

The pursuit of these optimization strategies is deeply intertwined with computer systems and often necessitates low-level programming in languages like C or C++. These languages provide fine-grained control over hardware resources, making them indispensable for high-performance AI development.



The existing method for training a deep learning model uses a framework like PyTorch or [TensorFlow](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1603.04467) based on Python. Python has a widespread ecosystem, and its syntax is friendly to people without programming experience. However, the performance of these frameworks doesn't fully exploit the device's computational resources because Python is an interpretational language.

In the crowded landscape of modern programming languages, Rust is different.[Programming Rust 2ed] [Rust is revolutionizing high-performance service development with its memory safety, resource management, and speed. ](https://doi.org/10.1145/3673648) [Rust offers the speed of a compiled language, the efficiency of a non-garbage-collected language, the type safety of a functional language—and a unique solution to memory safety problems.](Programming-Rust-2ed) The application of Rust in the field of machine learning is developing rapidly. The Hugging Face team uses Rust as the backend of the [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library to improve performance and versatility. Hundreds of Rust repositories have been established on GitHub, driving significant progress in Machine Learning.



However, Rust has emerged as a compelling alternative, steadily gaining traction in the AI domain. While C and C++ are established mainstays, Rust offers unique advantages, including memory safety, concurrency support, and a growing ecosystem of libraries tailored for AI development. Rust’s design philosophy prioritizes safety and performance, making it an attractive choice for developers seeking to balance computational efficiency with code reliability.

## The Unique Advantages of Rust in AI Development

#### A Memory-Safe Programming Language for High-Performance Systems

Rust is a memory-safe, compiled programming language that combines high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It has become a popular choice for building systems where performance is paramount, such as game engines, databases, operating systems, and applications targeting WebAssembly.

Rust, named after the rust fungus, originated as a side project by Graydon Hoare in 2007. In 2009, it gained sponsorship from Mozilla, and since 2016, it has consistently been ranked as the most loved programming language in developer surveys. Rust enthusiasts are affectionately known as "Rustaceans." According to the [2023 StackOverflow survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#programming-scripting-and-markup-languages), Rust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers want to use it again next year.

Rust's consistent recognition as the "Most Loved Programming Language" in the annual StackOverflow Developer Survey for several consecutive years alone makes it worthy of serious study. While the merits of Rust as a programming language are well-documented, this discussion will focus on a few personal impressions from my experience with it.

Earlier this year, the United States did some research and tried to figure out which language would be the safest as they wanted to overhaul their cyber security and defense systems and also improve the quality and resilience of their services. The report mentions "Rust, one example of a memory safe programming language, has the three requisite properties above, but has not yet been proven in space systems."

#### Memory Management: Ownership and Borrowing

Traditional high-level languages often rely on garbage collectors to manage memory, abstracting away manual control but sometimes introducing runtime overhead. Conversely, low-level languages like C and C++ provide explicit functions for memory management, such as malloc and free, but leave room for critical errors like memory leaks or undefined behavior. Rust takes a novel approach, achieving memory safety without a garbage collector through its ownership and borrowing system.

```rust
let s: String = String::from("hello"); // `s` owned the value of string
let _borrow: String = s; // _borrow takes the ownership of s
println!("{:?}", s); // error: borrow of moved value: `s`
```

In Rust, every variable is immutable by default, enabling values to be stored on the stack, which offers minimal performance overhead. Mutable variables or objects with sizes unknown at compile time are allocated on the heap. Each value in a Rust program is assigned a single "owner" variable, and when the owner goes out of scope, the associated memory is automatically deallocated.

When a program needs to access a value without taking ownership, it can "borrow" a reference to the memory. Borrowing is governed by strict rules enforced by Rust’s borrow checker at compile time, ensuring memory safety and preventing data races in concurrent programs. This system offers developers fine-grained control over performance without sacrificing safety.

```rust
let s: String = String::from("hello");
let _borrow: &String = &s; // borrowed `s` as immutable.
println!("{:?}", s);
```

## Inference

Inference is becoming a natural and promising application of Rust in artificial intelligence, especially for edge devices. Most traditional model inference relies on interpreter programming languages such as Python. However, in some high-performance situations, these interpreter languages may not satisfy these requirements. 

While server-side AI continues to be dominated by CUDA and C/C++ due to GPU usage, Rust is gaining popularity thanks to its integration into the Linux kernel, increasing support from platforms like Hugging Face, and improving GPU compatibility. These advancements position Rust to play a significant role in server-side AI applications.

Rust has been essential for intelligent devices, particularly those utilizing RISC-V architectures. A notable recent development is Vivo's launch of BlueOS, an AI operating system fully developed in Rust, which underscores its capabilities in edge computing.

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of optimizing performance due to their significant computational requirements and slow inference speeds. As LLMs continue to develop, enhancing computational efficiency will be crucial. The advanced language features of Rust make it particularly well-suited to address these challenges, creating an ideal partnership for advancing inference technologies in artificial intelligence.

## Middleware

The next significant advancement of Rust in AI is in middleware, especially those that support large language models (LLMs). Among these, vector search libraries are particularly prominent, with Qdrant leading due to its outstanding performance and user-friendly design. Additionally, frameworks like Meilisearch have gained considerable popularity as a mature alternative to ElasticSearch for full-text search. The middleware ecosystem is further enhanced by notable tools such as Tantivy, Toshi, Lnx, and Websurfx.

An intriguing advancement in this field is Paradedb, which combines full-text and semantic search capabilities within SQL queries, introducing innovative design paradigms. In addition to search technologies, the ecosystem of Rust includes various components such as Polars for data frame processing, Vector for pipeline visualization, SurrealDB for document-graph databases, and CeresDB for time-series data. The emergence of AI agents, highlighted by projects like SmartGPT, emphasizes the increasing influence of Rust in middleware development.

The scope of middleware goes beyond basic components; it includes memory management, task scheduling, resource pooling, task orchestration, and workflow design, particularly for applications centered around large language models (LLMs). As the application layer evolves, the growing complexity of LLM-driven systems will require more advanced middleware solutions. Rust, known for its strong performance and versatility, is well-suited to tackle these emerging challenges.

## Training

In the domain of training, Rust is gradually expanding its presence beyond inference, though its role remains in an exploratory and nascent phase. While Rust shows promise in stable engineering applications, its adoption for algorithm development is still limited.

For engineering-focused use cases, Rust, like many programming languages, can provide user-friendly APIs or command-line interfaces, enabling streamlined data preparation and training initiation. However, algorithm development demands frequent modifications to underlying architectures, such as adding or removing modules. In this area, Python maintains a clear advantage due to its extensive ecosystem and accessibility. Frameworks like PyTorch exemplify this, offering unparalleled flexibility and ease of use. Originally a Lua-based framework with limited adoption, PyTorch rose to dominance after integrating Python, surpassing predecessors like Caffe and TensorFlow to become the preferred choice for machine learning practitioners.

If Rust aims to replicate the success of PyTorch, a critical question arises: what unique value does it offer compared to Python-based solutions? Its APIs and interfaces are likely to mirror existing frameworks, as seen with the Transformers library influencing similar designs in PaddleNLP and ModelScope. Without compelling differentiation, transitions to Rust-based frameworks may remain unnecessary for most users.

The potential niche lies Rust in edge-device training, where its performance and memory efficiency could offer significant advantages. This aligns with the strengths of Rust, providing a promising direction for further exploration in the AI training ecosystem. However, achieving widespread adoption in algorithm development will require substantial innovation and differentiation from established Python-based frameworks.

## Current Applications of Rust in AI

## Challenges Facing Rust in AI Development

While the previous sections highlighted Rust's opportunities and strengths within the AI ecosystem, it is equally crucial to address potential challenges and disruptions.

Foremost among these is the enduring dominance of C and C++ in many AI-related domains. This status quo shows no immediate signs of change. For most users, as long as Python continues to offer a seamless and efficient interface for high-level operations, the choice of underlying implementation languages remains largely inconsequential, leaving C and C++ firmly entrenched in their roles.

Another challenge arises from emerging programming languages explicitly designed for AI. Mojo, for instance, has recently gained attention for its ambition to combine Python’s usability with C’s performance. Although still in its early stages, Mojo reflects a broader trend: the evolution of AI could inspire the development of languages tailored specifically to its unique demands. This raises an intriguing possibility—could a language purpose-built for large-scale models emerge in the future? Such innovations could present formidable competition to Rust and other general-purpose languages in the AI domain.
