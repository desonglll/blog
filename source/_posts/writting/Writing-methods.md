- Abstract
    - What is the research used for? (Introduce the Object, Normally a practical something: a medical neural)
    - The disadvantage of existing methods. (Expensive, Cost, Low accuracy)
    - In this paper, we introduce XXX: a …
        - It includes…
        - Firstly(Initially), we proposed a method
        - Meanwhile, we noticed the previous method could not achieve the expected performance.
            - Thus we propose a … to tackle this.
        - Besides, we integrating … to our model to improve something/to tackle this challenge
        - Extensive experiments show that our … significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on …datasets without increasing the cost.
        - To mitigate the … caused by …
