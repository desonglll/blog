# A Comprehensive Overview of Rust's Role and Potential Directions in AI Development

## Introduction

> Background: Briefly describe the development of artificial intelligence and its requirements for programming languages (such as performance, safety, and concurrency)

The advent of large language models (LLMs), epitomized by models such as [ChatGPT](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49313245), has ushered in a transformative era in artificial intelligence (AI). These models have significantly expanded the potential applications of AI, enabling a wide range of innovative products. Their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text has redefined the way AI is applied across industries, demonstrating exceptional progress in natural language processing. This breakthrough marks a pivotal moment in AI development, highlighting the need for advanced computational methods to manage the increasing scale and complexity of modern AI systems.

[The development of LLMs, characterized by their vast scale and numerous parameters, has led to unparalleled performance in natural language tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). However, such advancements come with substantial computational requirements, particularly regarding memory, processing power, and energy efficiency. As these models grow, the demand for high-performance programming languages capable of optimizing these resources has never been more critical. The efficiency of an AI system is heavily influenced by how well its underlying code manages these resources, particularly in large-scale deployments.

One of the primary challenges in scaling AI models is the memory and computational burden associated with managing billions of parameters, typically represented as floating-point numbers (e.g., FP32). Quantization techniques, such as converting to FP16, BF16, or even integer formats, offer an effective solution to mitigate the memory footprint and speed up execution. These techniques are essential for the efficient deployment of LLMs, particularly on resource-constrained platforms such as mobile devices or edge devices.

In addition to memory optimization, parallelism is a cornerstone of high-performance AI systems. Given the inherently parallelizable nature of tasks like training large neural networks, programming languages must support efficient parallel computation. GPUs and TPUs have become central to this process, with specialized hardware accelerating the training and inference stages. Even in the absence of these devices, modern CPUs can achieve significant performance improvements through data-level, instruction-level, and thread-level parallelism. This necessitates programming languages that offer strong concurrency models, enabling developers to fully exploit the capabilities of the hardware.

The success of AI applications hinges not only on computational performance but also on the safety and reliability of the systems. Memory safety is a critical concern, especially when dealing with large-scale models that require extensive memory management. Traditional low-level languages such as C and C++ provide fine-grained control over hardware, allowing developers to optimize performance, but they come with the risk of memory leaks and race conditions. The need for a safer programming model that reduces these risks while maintaining high performance is growing. Modern programming languages such as **Rust** offer significant advantages in this regard, as they combine fine-grained control over system resources with strict memory safety guarantees, making them increasingly popular for AI development.

Thus, as AI systems continue to evolve, the demand for programming languages that can balance **performance, safety**, and **concurrency** becomes paramount. The ability to write high-performance code that is both memory-safe and capable of efficient parallelism is critical to AI technologies' continued success and scalability. With its ownership model and thread-safety features, languages like Rust are emerging as strong contenders for AI development, particularly in resource-intensive models like LLMs.

> Rust's Uniqueness: Emphasizing How Rust's Memory Safety, Performance, and Concurrency Model Meet the Needs of AI Development.

The existing methods for training deep learning models commonly utilize frameworks like PyTorch or  [TensorFlow](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1603.04467), which are based on **Python**. Python has gained widespread popularity due to its accessible syntax and extensive ecosystem, making it particularly attractive to developers without deep programming experience. However, while Python excels in ease of use, its interpreted nature limits the ability to fully exploit modern hardware's computational resources. As a result, performance in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch often falls short in terms of maximizing hardware utilization, especially when scaling deep learning models.

In contrast, [**Rust** stands out in the crowded landscape of modern programming languages. Rust is rapidly gaining traction, particularly in high-performance applications, due to its memory safety, fine-grained resource management, and speed.](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.05503) Unlike Python, Rust is a compiled language that ensures direct access to system resources, which significantly enhances performance. Rust’s memory safety features—achieved through its ownership model and absence of garbage collection—allow for precise control over memory usage while preventing common issues such as memory leaks or race conditions, which are particularly important in large-scale AI applications.

Rust’s **concurrency model** further strengthens its suitability for AI development. AI applications, particularly those involving large-scale data processing or neural network training, require efficient parallel execution to fully leverage modern hardware. Rust’s concurrency model ensures thread safety without needing a garbage collector, making it highly effective in environments where concurrency and parallelism are essential. This is a significant advantage over languages like Python, where concurrency is often limited by Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and memory management challenges.

Rust’s unique combination of **memory safety**, **performance**, and **concurrency** makes it an ideal candidate for addressing the growing demands of AI development. Its efficiency in resource management and the ability to exploit parallelism while maintaining safety guarantees are critical for scaling AI models, making Rust a powerful tool in the evolving field of machine learning.

> Thesis Objective: Elucidating the Current State, Challenges, and Future Potential of Rust in AI Development

The goal of this paper is to explore the current state, challenges, and future potential of Rust in AI development. While Rust has demonstrated significant promise in high-performance AI applications due to its memory safety, speed, and concurrency capabilities, its adoption in the AI field remains limited compared to established languages like Python. This paper will discuss the ongoing developments, the challenges faced in integrating Rust with AI frameworks, and the opportunities it presents for advancing AI research and deployment, particularly in resource-constrained environments and large-scale model training.

## Overview of Rust Programming Language

#### A Memory-Safe Programming Language for High-Performance Systems

Rust is a memory-safe, compiled programming language that combines high-level simplicity with low-level performance. It has become a popular choice for building systems where performance is paramount, such as game engines, databases, operating systems, and applications targeting WebAssembly.

Rust, named after the rust fungus, originated as a side project by Graydon Hoare in 2007. In 2009, it gained sponsorship from Mozilla, and since 2016, it has consistently been ranked as the most loved programming language in developer surveys. Rust enthusiasts are affectionately known as "Rustaceans." According to the [2023 StackOverflow survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#programming-scripting-and-markup-languages), Rust is the most admired language, more than 80% of developers want to use it again next year.

Rust's consistent recognition as the "Most Loved Programming Language" in the annual StackOverflow Developer Survey for several consecutive years alone makes it worthy of serious study. While the merits of Rust as a programming language are well-documented, this discussion will focus on a few personal impressions from my experience with it.

The application of Rust in machine learning is progressing quickly, driven by its ability to handle intensive computational tasks with greater efficiency. Notably, the **Hugging Face** team uses Rust as the backend of its [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library to boost performance and versatility. The use of Rust has led to more efficient processing in tokenization, a crucial step in many NLP (Natural Language Processing) pipelines. Furthermore, Rust has become a key language in the development of AI tools and libraries, with hundreds of Rust repositories dedicated to machine learning and AI applications appearing on GitHub.

Earlier this year, the United States did some research and tried to figure out which language would be the safest as they wanted to overhaul their cyber security and defense systems and also improve the quality and resilience of their services. The report mentions "Rust, one example of a memory safe programming language, has the three requisite properties above, but has not yet been proven in space systems."

#### Memory Management: Ownership and Borrowing

Traditional high-level languages often rely on garbage collectors to manage memory, abstracting away manual control but sometimes introducing runtime overhead. Conversely, low-level languages like C and C++ provide explicit functions for memory management, such as malloc and free, but leave room for critical errors like memory leaks or undefined behavior. Rust takes a novel approach, achieving memory safety without a garbage collector through its ownership and borrowing system.

```rust
let s: String = String::from("hello"); // `s` owned the value of string
let _borrow: String = s; // _borrow takes the ownership of s
println!("{:?}", s); // error: borrow of moved value: `s`
```

In Rust, every variable is immutable by default, enabling values to be stored on the stack, which offers minimal performance overhead. Mutable variables or objects with sizes unknown at compile time are allocated on the heap. Each value in a Rust program is assigned a single "owner" variable, and when the owner goes out of scope, the associated memory is automatically deallocated.

When a program needs to access a value without taking ownership, it can "borrow" a reference to the memory. Borrowing is governed by strict rules enforced by Rust’s borrow checker at compile time, ensuring memory safety and preventing data races in concurrent programs. This system offers developers fine-grained control over performance without sacrificing safety.

```rust
let s: String = String::from("hello");
let _borrow: &String = &s; // borrowed `s` as immutable.
println!("{:?}", s);
```

## Rust in AI

### Inference

Inference is becoming a natural and promising application of Rust in artificial intelligence, especially for edge devices. Most traditional model inference relies on interpreter programming languages such as Python. However, in some high-performance situations, these interpreter languages may not satisfy these requirements. 

While server-side AI continues to be dominated by CUDA and C/C++ due to GPU usage, Rust is gaining popularity thanks to its integration into the Linux kernel, increasing support from platforms like Hugging Face, and improving GPU compatibility. These advancements position Rust to play a significant role in server-side AI applications.

Rust has been essential for intelligent devices, particularly those utilizing RISC-V architectures. A notable recent development is Vivo's launch of BlueOS, an AI operating system fully developed in Rust, which underscores its capabilities in edge computing.

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of optimizing performance due to their significant computational requirements and slow inference speeds. As LLMs continue to develop, enhancing computational efficiency will be crucial. The advanced language features of Rust make it particularly well-suited to address these challenges, creating an ideal partnership for advancing inference technologies in artificial intelligence.

### Middleware

The next significant advancement of Rust in AI is in middleware, especially those that support large language models (LLMs). Among these, vector search libraries are particularly prominent, with Qdrant leading due to its outstanding performance and user-friendly design. Additionally, frameworks like Meilisearch have gained considerable popularity as a mature alternative to ElasticSearch for full-text search. The middleware ecosystem is further enhanced by notable tools such as Tantivy, Toshi, Lnx, and Websurfx.

An intriguing advancement in this field is Paradedb, which combines full-text and semantic search capabilities within SQL queries, introducing innovative design paradigms. In addition to search technologies, the ecosystem of Rust includes various components such as Polars for data frame processing, Vector for pipeline visualization, SurrealDB for document-graph databases, and CeresDB for time-series data. The emergence of AI agents, highlighted by projects like SmartGPT, emphasizes the increasing influence of Rust in middleware development.

The scope of middleware goes beyond basic components; it includes memory management, task scheduling, resource pooling, task orchestration, and workflow design, particularly for applications centered around large language models (LLMs). As the application layer evolves, the growing complexity of LLM-driven systems will require more advanced middleware solutions. Rust, known for its strong performance and versatility, is well-suited to tackle these emerging challenges.

### Training

In the domain of training, Rust is gradually expanding its presence beyond inference, though its role remains in an exploratory and nascent phase. While Rust shows promise in stable engineering applications, its adoption for algorithm development is still limited.

For engineering-focused use cases, Rust, like many programming languages, can provide user-friendly APIs or command-line interfaces, enabling streamlined data preparation and training initiation. However, algorithm development demands frequent modifications to underlying architectures, such as adding or removing modules. In this area, Python maintains a clear advantage due to its extensive ecosystem and accessibility. Frameworks like PyTorch exemplify this, offering unparalleled flexibility and ease of use. Originally a Lua-based framework with limited adoption, PyTorch rose to dominance after integrating Python, surpassing predecessors like Caffe and TensorFlow to become the preferred choice for machine learning practitioners.

If Rust aims to replicate the success of PyTorch, a critical question arises: what unique value does it offer compared to Python-based solutions? Its APIs and interfaces are likely to mirror existing frameworks, as seen with the Transformers library influencing similar designs in PaddleNLP and ModelScope. Without compelling differentiation, transitions to Rust-based frameworks may remain unnecessary for most users.

The potential niche lies Rust in edge-device training, where its performance and memory efficiency could offer significant advantages. This aligns with the strengths of Rust, providing a promising direction for further exploration in the AI training ecosystem. However, achieving widespread adoption in algorithm development will require substantial innovation and differentiation from established Python-based frameworks.

## Current Applications of Rust in AI



## Challenges Facing Rust in AI Development

While the previous sections highlighted Rust's opportunities and strengths within the AI ecosystem, it is equally crucial to address potential challenges and disruptions.

Foremost among these is the enduring dominance of C and C++ in many AI-related domains. This status quo shows no immediate signs of change. For most users, as long as Python continues to offer a seamless and efficient interface for high-level operations, the choice of underlying implementation languages remains largely inconsequential, leaving C and C++ firmly entrenched in their roles.

Another challenge arises from emerging programming languages explicitly designed for AI. Mojo, for instance, has recently gained attention for its ambition to combine Python’s usability with C’s performance. Although still in its early stages, Mojo reflects a broader trend: the evolution of AI could inspire the development of languages tailored specifically to its unique demands. This raises an intriguing possibility—could a language purpose-built for large-scale models emerge in the future? Such innovations could present formidable competition to Rust and other general-purpose languages in the AI domain.
